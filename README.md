# PiKaGu : An OS X Pkg uninstaller (Tested on 10.7 -> 10.15)
#### Pikagu is an OS X Pkg uninstaller shell script that allows you to uninstall one or more pkg to have a clean uninstall.

## Step by Step :

1. PiKaGu will check your OS Version, telling you if your OS Version is tested or not.  
_**Also if your OS Version is compatible with snapshots it will ask you if you want to do one.**_

2. PiKaGu will list you all the Pkg installed.  
_**It will not display the system's package.**_

3. Choose the packages that you want to uninstall by typing their name down or by copying their name **ONE BY ONE**.  

4. PiKaGu will uninstall the selected packages and will ask for a verification before every package.  
_**The suppresion of the files will require the password of a Sudoers**_

5. After PiKaGu has unistalled all the packages you choose you can just close the window.

### If you find any bug or if you have ideas to make the script better don't mind writting in the "Issues" section :)
